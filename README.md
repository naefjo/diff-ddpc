# Diff-DDPC

---

`diff-ddpc` is a differentiable implementation of Data-Driven Predictive Control.
It implements off-the-shelf state-of-the-art data-driven algorithms in predictive control,
streamlining research efforts and accelerating adoption in novel environments.

By providing a modular framework, `diff-ddpc` allows the user tailor the optimal control problem
according to their requirements given the provided building blocks. Furthermore, the differentiable
implementation lends itself to effective hyperparameter optimization and incorporation into larger
learning-based control stacks.
